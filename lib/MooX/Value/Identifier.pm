=head1 NAME

MooX::Value::Identifier - Value object class representing a legal C identifier

=head1 VERSION

This document describes MooX::Value::Identifier version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MooX::Value::Identifier;

    my $ident = MooX::Value::Identifier->new( 'foo' );
    my $userident = MooX::Value::Domain->new( $unsafe_identifier );
    # We'll only get here if the $unsafe_identifier was a legal identifier

    print "'", $userident->value, "' is a valid identifier.\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is deprecated. It has been replaced by the L<Value::Object>
distribution.

A C<MooX::Value::Identifier> value object represents a legal C identifier. This
definition is actually used in more than just C. An identifier is limited to
the ASCII uppercase and lowercase letters, the ASCII digits, and the
underscore.  The initial character of an identifier cannot be a digit. The C
standard does not impose a length limit, so this class does not either. In
actual use, there are a particular strings that are not allowed as identifiers
(like C keywords). This class does not enforce that restriction.

If these criteria are not met, an exception is thrown.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 MooX::Value::Identifier->new( $str )

Create a new identifier object if the supplied string is a valid identifier.
Otherwise throw an exception.

=head2 $id->value()

Returns a string that represents the value of the object.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

C<MooX::Value::Identifier> requires no configuration files or environment variables.
