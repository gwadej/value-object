=head1 NAME

MooX::Value - Base class for minimal Value Object classes (DEPRECATED)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes MooX::Value version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MooX::Value::Identifier;

    use Moo;
    use namespace::clean;

    extends 'MooX::Value';

    sub _is_valid
    {
        my ($self, $value) = @_;
        return $value =~ m/\A[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\z/;
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is deprecated. It has been replaced by the L<Value::Object> module.

This distribution was originally conceived as very Moo-specific. The actual module
ended up using Moo, but not really being tightly bound to the internals of Moo.

This class serves as a base class for classes implementing the I<Value Object>
pattern. The core principles of a Value Object class are:

=over 4

=item The meaning of the object is solely its value.

=item The value of the object is immutable.

=item The object is validated on creation.

=back

Every C<MooX::Value>-derived object has a minimum of a C<value> method that
returns its value.  There is no mutator methods that allow for changing the
value of the object. If you need an object with a new value, create a new
object. The concept is that one of these objects is more like the integer B<5>,
than the variable C<$v> that contains the value. You cannot modify the value of
B<5>, but you can make a new integer that is the value of B<5> changed by some
amount.

The core of this particular Value Object implementation is the validation on
creation. Every subclass of C<MooX::Value> must override either the
C<_is_valid> or the C<_why_invalid> method. The C<_is_valid> method determines
the validity of the supplied value. If the supplied value is not valid,
C<_is_valid> returns false and the constructor throws an exception. If you
prefer to have control over the message of the exception, you can override
C<_why_invalid> which returns C<undef> for a valid value and information about
why the value is not valid otherwise. The result is that any C<MooX::Value>
object is guaranteed to be validated by its constructor.

There is a temptation when designing a Value object to include extra
functionality into the class. The C<MooX::Value> class instead aims for the
minimal function consistent with the requirements listed above. If a subclass
needs more functionality it can be added to that subclass at the point of need.
Valid extra functionality might be accessors for part of the value if it is
made of smaller pieces. Any mutator methods would violate the fundamental
design of the C<MooX::Value> base class and are, therefore, discouraged.

=head1 INTERFACE

The class definition is currently very new. There is a potential that the
interface may change in the near-term. In particular, the L<Subclassing
Interface> has a potential for some modification to make it more flexible.

=head2 Public Interface

The public interface only supports creation of the object and returning the
value of the object.

=head3 $class->new( $value )

The new method is a constructor taking a single value. If the value is deemed
valid by the C<_why_invalid> internal method (which defaults to checking the
internal C<_is_valid> method if not overridden), an object is returned.
Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head3 $obj->value()

Return a copy of the value of the C<MooX::Value>-derived object. This method
should not return modifiable internal state.

=head2 Subclassing Interface

The following methods may be overridden by any subclass to provide actual
validation and reporting of errors.

=head3 $self->_is_valid( $value )

This method B<must> be overridden in any subclass (unless you override
C<_why_invalid> instead).

It performs the validation on the supplied value and returns C<true> if the
parameter is valid and C<false> otherwise.

=head3 $self->_why_invalid( $value )

By default, this method calls the C<_is_invalid> method and returns c<undef> on
success or a list of three values on failure. The default error message is
generic, but it makes creating subclasses by just overriding C<_is_valid> easier.

By overriding this method instead of C<_is_valid> you gain control over the
error message reported in the exception. If the supplied value is not valid,
C<_why_invalid> returns a list of three values:

=over 4

=item $why

This is the only required return item. It is a short message thrown as the
exception describing how the value is not valid.

=item $longmsg

This optional return item is intended to provide a more detailed error message
than C<$why>. With the default exception method, this message is not used.

=item $data

This optional return item is intended to provide data from the invalidation that
could be used for higher level reporting. This data is not used by the default
exception method.

=back

=head3 $self->_throw_exception( $why, $longmsg, $data )

This internal method handles the actual throwing of the exception. If you need
to use something more advanced than a simple C<die>, you can override this
method. The C<_throw_exception> method B<must> throw an exception by some
means. It should never return.

=head3 $self->_untaint( $value )

This internal method returns an untainted copy of the value attribute. The
base class version of this method performs a brute force untainting of any
scalar value. Since it is only called after the value is validated, this
should be safe.

A subclass can override this method to perform some other kind of untainting.
If the value is not a simple scalar, the subclass must override this method if
untainting is desired.

=head2 Internal Interface

These methods are documented for completeness, but are called internally and
do not require any modification.

=head3 BUILDARGS

Internal function that makes the simple constructor compatible with the C<Moo>
constructor interface.

=head3 BUILD

Internal function that validates the constructor input.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item C<< %s: Invalid parameter when creating value object. >>

The supplied parameter is not valid for the Value class.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

C<MooX::Value> requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<Moo>, L<namespace::clean>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

C<bug-moox-value@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Before writing this module, I did examine other modules that implemented the Value
Object pattern. Ultimately, I determined that none really matched my need.

=over 4

=item Class::Value

Implements typed Value objects. Unfortunately, the base class has a relatively large
interface (44 public methods). Most of these would only apply to number-like objects.
Many of the derived classes were not number-like, leading to interface surprise.

=item Class::Value::*

There are a number of classes derived from Class::Value that implement particular
Value objects. They all share the design decisions of Class::Value.

=item Time::HiRes::Value

Implements a reasonable value object for microsecond level times. It is not a
general approach to Value objects. The fact that the objects created are
mutable violated one of the constraints I was aiming for.

=item Scalar::Boolean

Another Value-like object. Limits the value of created object to Perl boolean values.
It is not a general approach to Value objects. Created objects are also mutable, so
they do not meet the criteria I was aiming for.

=item Moose::Autobox::Value

This is the core funcitonality allowing autoboxing of Perl primitives, not Value
objects.

=back

This module is now replaced by L<Value::Object>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Joshua Brandt for suggesting the idea of untainting the value.
