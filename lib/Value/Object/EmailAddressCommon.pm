=head1 NAME

Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon - A value object representing a valid email address.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon version 0.10

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon;

    my $email = Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon->new( 'webmaster@example.com' );
    my $me    = Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon->new( 'gwadej@cpan.org' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon> value object represents a valid common
email address.  That email address may not represent an address that can
actually receive an email, but the form of the address is at least valid.

The only difference between the common email address and the specification of
the email address as given by RFC 5322 is that the common email address only
supports the dotted form. In many practical applications, programmers do not
seem to support the quoted email form. This Value class handles those cases.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon->new( $emailstr )

Create a value object if the supplied C<$emailstr> validates according to RFC 5322.
Otherwise throw an exception.

=head2 Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon->new_canonical( $emailstr )

Create a value object if the supplied C<$emailstr> validates according to RFC 5322.
Otherwise throw an exception.

Unlike the C<new> method, the ASCII characters of the domain portion of the
supplied C<$emailstr> are lowercased before the email address is created. The
canonical version of the domain is always lowercase.

=head2 $email->value()

Return a string matching the full email address of the Value object.

=head2 $email->local_part()

Return a string matching the local part of the Value object.

=head2 $email->domain()

Return a C<Value::Object::Domain> object representing the domain portion of the
Value object.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

C<Value::Object::EmailAddressCommon> requires no configuration files or environment variables.
