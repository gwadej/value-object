=head1 NAME

Value::Object::ValidationUtils - Utility functions for validation of value objects

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Value::Object::ValidationUtils version 0.13

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Value::Object::ValidationUtils;

    print "Yes\n"
        if Value::Object::ValidationUtils::is_valid_domain_name( $foo );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some C<Value::Object>-derived objects share code needed for validation. Rather
than duplicating the knowledge of that information in multiple value objects,
the knowledge and utilities are collected into this module.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 why_invalid_domain_name( $str )

Returns a three item list if the supplied C<$str> is not a valid domain name
as specified by RFCs 1123 and 2181. The first item is a short message
describing the problem. The second item is empty and the third may contain a
string with the part of the domain name that is invalid (depending on how it
is invalid).

Returns an empty list if C<$str> is a valid domain name.

=head2 is_valid_domain_name( $str )

Returns true if the supplied C<$str> is a valid domain name as specified by
RFCs 1123 and 2181. Otherwise, return false.

=head2 why_invalid_domain_label( $str )

Returns a three item list if the supplied C<$str> is not a valid domain label
as specified by RFCs 1123 and 2181. The first item is a short message
describing the problem. The second item is empty and the third item is
C<undef>.

Returns an empty list if C<$str> is a valid domain label.

=head2 is_valid_domain_label( $str )

Returns true if the supplied C<$str> is a valid domain label as specified by
RFCs 1123 and 2181. Otherwise, return false.

=head2 why_invalid_email_local_part( $str )

Returns a three item list if the supplied C<$str> is not a valid email local
part as specified by RFC 5322. The first item is a short message describing
the problem. The second item is empty and the third item is C<undef>.

Returns an empty list if C<$str> is a valid email local part.

=head2 is_valid_email_local_part( $str )

Returns true if the supplied C<$str> is a valid email address as specified by
RFC 5322. Otherwise, return false.

=head2 why_invalid_common_email_local_part( $str )

Returns a three item list if the supplied C<$str> is not a valid email local
part mostly as specified by RFC 5322. The difference between the common version
of the email local part and the standard is that the common version does not
support the quoted form. This does seem to match the common usage of email
addresses that I've seem.

The first item is a short message describing the problem. The second item is
empty and the third item is C<undef>.

Returns an empty list if C<$str> is a valid common email local part.

=head2 is_valid_common_email_local_part( $str )

Returns true if the supplied C<$str> is a valid email address as specified by
common email address as defined by C<why_invalid_common_email_local_part>.
Otherwise, return false.

=head2 why_invalid_iso_8601_date( $str )

Returns a three item list if the supplied C<$str> is not a valid date as specified
by the W3C Date/Time format which conforms to ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).

The first item is a short message describing the problem. The second item is
empty and the third item is data relating to the failure.

Returns an empty list if C<$str> is a valid ISO 8601 date.

=head2 why_invalid_iso_8601_time( $str )

Returns a three item list if the supplied C<$str> is not a valid time as specified
by the W3C Date/Time format which conforms to ISO 8601 (HH:MM:SS(.SSS)?(Z|[+-]HH:MM)).

The first item is a short message describing the problem. The second item is
empty and the third item is data relating to the failure.

Returns an empty list if C<$str> is a valid ISO 8601 Time.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

C<Value::Object::ValidationUtils> requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES
