=head1 NAME

Value::Object::EmailAddress - A value object representing a valid email address.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Value::Object::EmailAddress version 0.10

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Value::Object::EmailAddress;

    my $email = Value::Object::EmailAddress->new( 'webmaster@example.com' );
    my $me    = Value::Object::EmailAddress->new( 'gwadej@cpan.org' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Value::Object::EmailAddress> value object represents a valid email address.
That email address may not represent an address that can actually receive an
email, but the form of the address is at least valid.

The specification of the email address defined by the 'addr-spec' in RFC 5322 3.4.1. It supports both
the quoted and dotted forms of the address. It does not support the inclusion of the display name,
such as C<< G. Wade Johnson <gwadej@cpan.org> >>.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Value::Object::EmailAddress->new( $emailstr )

Create a value object if the supplied C<$emailstr> validates according to RFC 5322.
Otherwise throw an exception.

=head2 Value::Object::EmailAddress->new_canonical( $emailstr )

Create a value object if the supplied C<$emailstr> validates according to RFC 5322.
Otherwise throw an exception.

Unlike the C<new> method, the ASCII characters of the domain portion of the
supplied C<$emailstr> are lowercased before the email address is created. The
canonical version of the domain is always lowercase.

=head2 $email->value()

Return a string matching the full email address of the Value object.

=head2 $email->local_part()

Return a string matching the local part of the Value object.

=head2 $email->domain()

Return a C<Value::Object::Domain> object representing the domain portion of the
Value object.
